# Advanced Linear Skip Search Visualizer

This project is my attempt to create an interactive web application that visualizes the Advanced Linear Skip Search algorithm. It provides a user-friendly interface to generate skip lists, perform searches, and observe the algorithm's behavior step-by-step. It started as just a basic html file but I ended up playing around with some JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Generate custom skip lists with configurable size and express lane intervals
- Visualize the skip list structure and comparison list
- Perform automated searches or step through the search process manually
- Adjust animation speed for better understanding
- Real-time logs and explanations of the search process

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-skip-search-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd linear-skip-search-visualizer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Configure the skip list:
   - Set the list size (10-100)
   - Set the express lane interval (2-10)
   - Set the animation speed (100-3000ms)

2. Click "Generate New Skip List" to create a new list based on your configuration.

3. Enter a search value in the "Search Value" input field.

4. Choose a search method:
   - Click "Start Search" for an automated search
   - Click "Step Through" to manually progress through the search

5. Observe the visualization, logs, and explanations as the search progresses.

6. Click "Reset" to clear the current search and start over.
